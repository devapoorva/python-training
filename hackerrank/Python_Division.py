# Task
# The provided code stub reads two integers,  and , from STDIN.

# Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division,  
# // . The second line should contain the result of float division,  / .

# No rounding or formatting is necessary.

# Example
# a = 3
# b = 5

# The result of the integer division . 3//5 = 0
# The result of the float division is . 3/5 = 0.6

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
print(a//b)
print(a/b)
